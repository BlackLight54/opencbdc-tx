-may put jmeter beside client, because calling from outside using 'docker exec' represents a major bottleneck
-may call from outside, if there are multiple clients, and each has a reasonable ammopunt of wallets( how do we find this out?)
-Or simply scale horizontally, and call one client from one thread with multiple threads from jmeter
-may implement configuration of horizontal scaling
